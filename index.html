            <p class="delayLargeReveal">
              Hello! I’m Adeeb Khaja Mohamed, a graduate student pursuing an MS in Data Analytics Engineering at George Mason University. I recently completed my undergraduate degree in Information Science at Ramaiah Institute of Technology, where I built a strong foundation in software development and data analytics through impactful projects and hands-on experiences. During my internship at the Indian Institute of Science, I developed advanced algorithms for optimizing air traffic management systems, demonstrating my technical expertise in Python and Django. My projects span various domains, from enhancing digital platforms to creating innovative web solutions that improve user interactions, showcasing my ability to address complex challenges with tech-driven solutions. Alongside my academic and technical pursuits, I held leadership roles in technology-focused clubs, where I fostered innovation and collaboration, further honing my leadership and teamwork skills. Now, as I delve deeper into the field of data analytics, my goal is to leverage my academic knowledge, technical skills, and leadership experience to drive impactful solutions in technology and analytics, with the long-term vision of establishing my own tech enterprise to deliver meaningful innovations.

            <h3 class="project-heading">DAIM - Decentralized AI and Data Marketplace</h3>
            <div class="project-description">
              <p>
                DAIM emerged as a hackathon project, driven by a mission to combat the centralization of AI and data. In
                a landscape dominated by a select few corporations, DAIM aimed to empower independent developers by
                offering a platform that allowed them to monetize their innovations while preserving privacy. Our vision
                for DAIM was to establish a decentralized ecosystem, uniting AI Service Publishers, Data or Model
                Contributors, and AI Service Consumers for mutual benefit. During the hackathon, DAIM enabled AI Service
                Publishers to submit datasets and models, which could be offered in private or public modes, sparking
                discussions in threads addressing specific problem statements. A unique feature was that with each
                consumer purchase, the value and price of datasets and models increased, benefiting creators and
                consumers alike. Contributors, in the form of threads, worked to enhance existing AI services, competing
                with original publishers and fellow contributors, with a validation process ensuring top-notch quality.
                Consumers accessed a dynamic marketplace of AI services and data offerings, confident in their privacy
                protection through secure computation methods. Every interaction within the hackathon project
                contributed to the growth and value of the datasets and models available. DAIM, as a hackathon
                initiative, embodied the potential to decentralize control, empower creators, and prioritize privacy in
                the realm of artificial intelligence, representing the future of AI and data accessibility.

                I developed an IoT project dedicated to real-time GPS tracking with a Raspberry Pi Zero W. The project's
                core mission was to enable precise location tracking for logistics, personal safety, and diverse
                applications. Leveraging the Raspberry Pi Zero W and GPS technology, this initiative provided a
                versatile platform for accurate location monitoring. It empowered users to create customized tracking

            <div class="project-description">
              <p>
                This project aimed to redefine multilingual communication by creating a system capable of maintaining both semantic and emotional accuracy during translation. It addresses the challenges of emotional misrepresentation in conventional translation models, ensuring culturally sensitive and emotionally nuanced outputs. At the core of the project is EmojiRoBERTa, a custom emotion-detection model developed specifically for this purpose. The system also integrates GPT-3.5 to process complex linguistic structures, enabling iterative translations that preserve intent and emotional tone. Cosine similarity checks were implemented to validate the consistency of emotional and semantic content across translations. The system achieved a BLEU score of 65.67% and a Macro F1 score of 69.30% for emotion detection, showcasing its effectiveness in bridging language and emotional gaps.
